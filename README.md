# Artificial-Intelligence-Proyect
Creation of graph and obstacles, solve them through heuristic algorithms

This program is an assignmet for the Artificial Intelligence course

The aim of the program is to have an area in which the user can draw nodes (points), each of them will have a small label 
indicating the number of node, then the user can link two nodes through an edge (line) with also a label indicating the distance
between the two nodes, this will be the number of pixels among them. 

The user can also add some polygons or shapes on the working area, this figures are going to be build with points as well,
once the user has place enough periods, a "fill polygon" is available which creates lines that connects all the points and 
fills the inner area with a solid colour, However, a polygon can't be drawn over a graph node or edge and viceversa.

Other feature is that the user can move the nodes and polygons around, but cannot place them one on top of another, not even
over an edge, and by the way, the label of the edges must change if the nodes change distance.

As you problably notice, the code it's not really good (neither my english), so advise and critisism are welcome, 
I'm here to learn and willing to hear your comments and suggestions.
